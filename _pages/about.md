Welcome to my site! I'm a science, data, and machine learning professional, mostly operating in the finance and sustainability spaces.

For professional enquiries, please contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judebowyer). My technical focus is in data integrations and machine learning:  This typically involves knowledge graphs, NLP, timeseries, or spatial data methods. I enjoy strategic discussions as much as delving into the technical details.
